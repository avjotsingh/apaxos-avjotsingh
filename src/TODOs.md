- persist the proposal number on disk 
- send prepares all at the same time
- synchronize the slow server (asynchronously)
- passive catch-up mechanism (if received last commited id > server's last committed id)
- do not send a reply message to client if transaction fails
- add timeout after receiving majority of promise messages
- synchronize acceptor if accept val is already committed (reset acceptor's acceptnum and acceptval)
- randomize delays after prepare phase failure
